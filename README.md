** A chatBot App for weather using the wit.ai Api **
All the dependencies can be installed

notes :
 - If you put all your source files in a src directory you can compile using Babel (to remove flow annotation and ES6 problem compatibilities) them to another directory by running (here I compile them to the /lib directory):
    `npm run build`

 - notes to run the app
    `npm install`
    `npm start`
