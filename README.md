**A chatBot App for weather using the wit.ai Api**

All the dependencies can be installed using the `npm install` command

notes :
For all the following npm scripts, refer to the `package.json` file
 - If you put all your source files in a src directory you can compile using Babel (to remove flow annotation and ES6 problem compatibilities) them to another directory by running (here I compile them to the /lib directory):
    `npm run build`

 - Commands to run the app

   `npm install` (for installing the various dependencies)

   `npm start` (for running the project)

   `npm run test` (for running the tests)

   `npm run coverage` (for running the code coverage with istanbul)
