**A chatBot App for weather using the wit.ai Api**

All the dependencies can be installed using the `npm install` command

notes :
 - If you put all your source files in a src directory you can compile using Babel (to remove flow annotation and ES6 problem compatibilities) them to another directory by running (here I compile them to the /lib directory):
    `npm run build`

 - Commands to run the app
 
   *`npm install`
 
   *`npm start`
